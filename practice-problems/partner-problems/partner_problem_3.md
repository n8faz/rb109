This code will output ``George``. Within a loop there is a **method definition**. This method is defined as ``name`` and returns the string ``"George"`` when being invoked, even though this method was defined inside of the scope of the ``loop`` method, it is still accessible outside of the scope, which is why the code outputs ``George`` when the method is being invoked and called on ``puts`` method to print to screen.
