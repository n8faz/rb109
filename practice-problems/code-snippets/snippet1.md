On line 1 variable ``a`` is initialized to reference the integer object ``1``. Then on line 3 the ``#loop`` method is invoked with a block denoted by ``do..end`` passed to it as an argument. Within this block, on line 4, ``#puts`` method is being invoked with ``a`` as an argument, which will output ``1`` to the screen, it is printing the object that ``a`` is referencing at that point in the code, and ``a`` is accessible inside of the ``#loop`` method scope because it was initialized in the outer scope. Then there is **variable reassignment** occuring on line 5. Variable ``a`` is being reassigned to the value `` a + 1``. This value is ``2``. Then the loop is exited with the ``break`` keyword on line 6. Outside of the scope of the ``#loop`` method, on line 9, ``#puts`` is being invoked with variable ``a`` passed to it as an argument again. Since variable ``a`` was initialized outside of the loops scope, and was reassigned within the block passed to loop as an argument, ``a`` is now pointing to the integer ``2`` and is what will be output to the screen.
