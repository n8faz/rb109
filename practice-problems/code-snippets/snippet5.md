On line 5, ``include?`` method is being invoked with array object ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`` and integer ``6`` passed to it as arguments. ``include?`` method is defined on line 1 and has two parameters, ``arr`` and ``search_item``. With the method invocation on line 5 and the arguments passed to it, the parameter ``arr`` is an alias for the array object ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`` and ``search_item`` is an alias for the integer ``6``. 

Within the method, the ``#each`` method is called on the parameter ``arr``, with a block denoted by curly braces passed to it as an argument. The block iterates through the collection with each element passed to the block as arguments for the parameter ``item``. Then the block is evaluated as true if the element is equal to the ``search_item`` parameter. Basically, the ``#each`` method is being used to test if the collection, in this case ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`` contains the object ``6``. The array object does not contain the integer ``6`` so the block called to the ``each`` method will evaluate to false each iteration. The ``#each`` method returns the collection that it iterated through, which will evaluate as truthy based on the ``truthiness`` concept that everything in Ruby will evaluate as true except ``false`` or ``nil``. The ``!`` operator is being called on the evaluation of the ``#each`` method and changes the boolean value returned to its opposite, in this case it takes ``true`` and changes it to ``false``. This is what the method invocation on line 5 will be evaluated to. ``false``.
