This code calls method ``#each`` to array object ``[1, 2, 3]``. A block is passed to ``#each`` as an argument. The block takes each element, passed in as an argument through the block parameter ``num``, and calls the method `#puts` to each element in the array. The ``#each`` method is used to iterate through a collection of elements, and calls a block, passed to ``#each`` as an argument, once for each element in the collection. Calling the given block on each element in the array object will result in the code outputting to the screen:
