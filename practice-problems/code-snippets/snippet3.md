On line 9, method ``short_long_short`` is being invoked with string objects ``'abc'`` and ``'defgh'`` passed to it as arguments. This method was defined on line 1 and contains a conditional if statement. The statement uses comparison operator ``>`` (greater than) on the operands ``string1.length`` and ``string2.length``. With the method invocation, string object `'abc'` is referenced by parameter ``string1`` and string object ``'defgh'`` is referenced by parameter ``string2``. The ``#length`` method called on both ``string1`` and ``string2`` returns the amount of characters the string contains as an integer. In this case, ``string1.length`` will return ``3`` and ``string2`` will return ``5``. With the value of the two operands being ``3`` and ``5`` the conditional if statement will evaluate to false, as ``3`` is not greater than ``5``. This results in the ``else`` statement being performed. In this case it is the concatenation of ``string1`` and ``string2``, adding ``string2`` to ``string1`` and then adding ``string1`` again. The use of string concatenation within the else statement will evaluate to ``'abcdefghabc'`` and is what will be returned when ``short_long_short`` is invoked on line 9.
