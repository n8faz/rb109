On line 5 two variables are being initialized, ``arr1`` and ``arr2``. ``arr1`` is initialized to reference the array object ``['hello']``. ``arr2`` is initialized to reference the array object ``['hello', 'world']``. On line 6 another variable, named ``merged`` is initialized. This variable is initialized to reference the return value of the method invocation of ``merge``, which has been defined on line 1. ``merge`` is invoked with two arguments passed to it, those arguments being variables ``arr1`` and ``arr2``. 

``merge`` has been defined with two parameters, ``array_1`` and ``array_2``. Within the method, the ``|`` method is being called on those parameters. The ``|`` method takes two arrays and returns the union of the two arrays, removing any duplicates while preserving the order. 

The return value of the method invocation ``merge`` will be the array object ``["hello", "world"]``. This is the combination of the arrays referenced by ``arr1`` and ``arr2``, removing the duplicate element string object ``'hello'``. 

On line 7, index reassignment is being performed on the array referenced by variable ``merged``. The reassignment, ``merged[0][0]``, is taking the value of the element at index ``0`` of the array, and reassigning the value at index ``0`` of the element, in this case it is the string object `'hello'` and the element at index ``0`` of this object is ``'h'``. This is being reassigned to ``J``. The index reassignment method is a mutating method, meaning the operation of changing ``'h'`` to ``'J'`` is being applied to the original object, so all variables referencing that object will recognize that change. This results in the output of lines 8-10 to be:

``` ruby
['Jello', 'world']
['Jello']
['hello', 'world']
```
