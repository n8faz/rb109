This code starts with a method definition. The method is named ``weird`` and has one parameter ``str``. Within the method, destructive method ``#downcase!`` is being called to the range of ``str`` ``0`` and the size of ``str`` minus ``1``.  Then parameter ``str`` is being called to ``puts`` to print ``str`` to screen. Outside of the method definition, variable ``word`` is being initialized to reference string object ``"HELLO"``. Then there is a method invocation of ``weird`` with ``word`` being passed as an argument. The method invocation returns nil and outputs ``HELLO`` to the screen.
