The following code does not print ``hEllo`` because within the method definition ``#upcase!`` is being called on ``str[1]`` which is returning the value of ``string`` at index ``1``. In this case that is ``e``. while the ``#upcase!`` method is mutating, it is being called upon the return value ``e``, not the object itself, so when printing the raw code version of ``str`` with method ``#p``, just ``"hello"`` is printed.
